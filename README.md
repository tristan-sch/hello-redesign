# DESIGN - UI REDESIGN

This is my assignment for Module 3 "Design - UI Redesign".

- [Go to the guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/614479b278de2900086b1e9d)

- [Go to my UI design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YzrJn4FYKkJrt4DP0uYMLu/Design---UI-Redesign?node-id=0%3A1)

## Intro

- I decided to do the proposed assignment and redid the [Italia Restaurant's website](http://italia.is/)

- I did 2 pages -> Home + Menu

## Structure

**I imagined it as a one pager**:

- Screen 1 is the hero section, very simple with nav bar + full screen image (I would have liked a darker image but did not find one) + headline + arrow to scroll down

- I wanted to reproduce and improve their image with a fire, to get a welcoming feeling by entering the website, same as entering the restaurant.

- Screen 2 is only a small description with pictures and a CTA

- The others screens (which I did not create) would be the "book a table" and "contact" sections

- And the come the menu page as external page

## Overall design

- **Colors**: _Black_ to bring a bit of fanciness as an Italian restaurant is not just about pizzas but well prepared-meals + _Green, white and red_ for the Italian flag

- **Font**: Merienda + Sarala because it sounds Italiannn :P

- **Shapes**: I wanted to reproduce the shape of a pizza slice with triangles like with the logo I redesigned (because I could not work with theirs)

## Toolbox

- **Pictures** come from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

- **Logo + Arrow-down** come from [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
